# Sierpinski-Triangle
Plays the chaos game and makes the Sierpinski triangle using the Python Turtle module.

The Sierpinski triangle is a self-similar fractal. It consists of an equilateral triangle, with smaller equilateral triangles recursively removed from its remaining area. It's named after the Polish mathematician Wacław Sierpiński.

The chaos game is played with an any-sided polygon, picking a random vertex, then moving a fixed distance to another random vertex, making a very cool pattern.
